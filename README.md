# Path_Finder

Reimplementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm with improvements to the former.
Latest release: version 1.0.1, built 01/01/2017 (DD/MM/YYYY).

Improved Dijkstra's algorithm uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) method for queuing nodes. NO sorting is conducted (for best speed). Nodes are evaluated in the order they are queued.

A* algorithm is included for comparison.

Software provides a means to benchmark the two path-finding algorithms separately.

Current version of software will only compile on a Windows platform.
